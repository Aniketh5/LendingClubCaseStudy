# Lending Club Case Study
> The primary objective is to leverage data analysis to mitigate the financial risks associated with lending to customers,
aiming to minimize potential losses. The overarching objective is to curtail credit loss by employing exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to identify
key factors influencing loan defaults.

## General Information
The company under consideration stands as the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating a spectrum of loans,
including personal, business, and medical procedure financing. Through an efficient online platform, borrowers gain
access to loans at lower interest rates. Like other lending institutions, providing loans to applicants with a higher
risk profile poses the most significant source of financial loss, known as credit loss. Credit loss represents the monetary
value lost by the lender when borrowers fail to repay, leading to a financial setback. In this scenario, customers
categorized as 'charged-off' are identified as defaulters, contributing to the credit loss.

## Conclusions
1. **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** The analysis indicates that loans with higher DTI ratios, particularly in the range of 10-15, have a higher likelihood of default. Therefore, careful consideration of a borrower's DTI is crucial in predicting the risk of default.

2. **Loan Purpose - Debt Consolidation:** Loans taken for debt consolidation purposes appear to have a higher chance of default. This suggests that understanding the borrower's intent behind the loan, especially if it's for consolidating debts, is essential in assessing credit risk.

3. **Loan Term:** The loan term is another critical factor. Loans with a 60-month term exhibit a higher chance of default compared to those with a 36-month term. Lenders should be cautious when extending loans with longer durations.

4. **Interest Rate:** There is a clear relationship between interest rates and default. Higher interest rates, especially above 20%, are associated with a greater likelihood of default. Setting appropriate interest rates based on risk assessment is vital in minimizing credit loss.

5. **Annual Income:** Borrowers with lower annual incomes, particularly below 50,000, show a higher probability of default. Evaluating a borrower's income against the loan amount is crucial in determining their repayment capacity.

6. **Loan Grade:** The loan grade serves as a risk indicator. Higher-grade loans (e.g., Grade A) are associated with lower default rates. Lenders should use grading systems effectively to gauge and manage risk.

7. **Verification Status:** Loans that are verified by the company or have source verification are associated with lower default rates. Verifying borrower information can contribute to more accurate risk assessment.

8. **Home Ownership:** Borrowers who own their homes exhibit a lower likelihood of default compared to those on mortgage or rent. Considering the stability of a borrower's housing situation is important in risk evaluation.

9. **Employment Length:** Borrowers with longer employment lengths, especially those with 10+ years of experience, tend to have a higher chance of fully repaying the loan. Employment history is a valuable factor in predicting creditworthiness.

10. **Loan Amount:** Specific loan amount ranges, such as loans between 30,000 - 35,000 or above 16,000, are associated with higher default rates. Carefully assessing and setting appropriate loan amounts based on risk profiles is essential.
